Mona is a Ahead Of Time compiled programming language written in Rust, the code generation and compilation is made with LLVM. 

## Usage

After [build](#) Mona, just run it and you will see that :
```
Usage: mona <COMMAND>

Commands:
  bobj  Builds a given file into an object file
  help  Print this message or the help of the given subcommand(s)

Options:
  -h, --help  Print help
```

For now only one subcommand exits, it's `bobj`, it's the contraction of `build an object`, this will transform the file passed in arguments and compiles it to an object file.

## Work to be done :
- [x] Lexer
- [x] Parser
- [ ] ~~Interpreter~~
- [x] ~~Make a good [REPL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Read%E2%80%93eval%E2%80%93print_loop)~~
- [ ] ~~a JIT with LLVM ?~~
- [ ] A AOT compiler
- [ ] Optimization and cleaning
- [ ] A good error system for the parser and the compiler -> https://github.com/Larsouille25/mona/issues/4
- [ ] Implement the docs ;)
