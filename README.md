# Mona
Mona is an interpreted programming language written in Rust. Run Mona code with the REPL or passing a source file.

## How to use it?

It's not fully implemented yet, but you can use it. After compiling Mona, run it like this:

```
$ ./mona
Mona 0.0.0-dev, to exit enter `.quit`
~> 
``` 
Type anything you want, if there is an error it'll show you like that for lexing errors: 

```
Err: Lexer, in file `<stdin>` at line 1 :
 ... |
  1  | 1 + 2 * a
 ... |         ^
               Illegal Character
```
Just keep in mind that for the moment, Mona can only lexer numbers and math operators like `+` `-` `/` `*`.

By default when you type nothing shows up, it's normal you need to enable flags. By typing `./mona --help`, you will see a bunch of flags, by default the interpreter flag is enabled but if you want to see the result of the lexer add `-l` to the command, and if you want to also see the result of the parser you just need to add `-p`. The command will look like that `./mona -lp`.

e.g:

```
$ ./mona
Mona 0.0.0-dev, to exit enter `.quit`
~> (2 + 8) * 4
[LParen, Int(2), Plus, Int(8), RParen, Mul, Int(4)]

ParseNode {
    children: [
        ParseNode {
            children: [
                ParseNode {
                    children: [],
                    entry: Int(
                        2,
                    ),
                },
                ParseNode {
                    children: [],
                    entry: Int(
                        8,
                    ),
                },
            ],
            entry: Plus,
        },
        ParseNode {
            children: [],
            entry: Int(
                4,
            ),
        },
    ],
    entry: Mul,
}
```
The ParseNode is the Mona AST and the vector is the vector that is passed to Mona

## Work to be done :
- [x] Lexer
- [x] Parser
- [ ] ~~Interpreter~~
- [x] Make a good [REPL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Read%E2%80%93eval%E2%80%93print_loop)
- [ ] a JIT with LLVM ?
- [ ] Optimization and cleaning
- [ ] A good error system for the parser and the interpreter / JIT -> [#4](https://github.com/Larsouille25/mona/issues/4)
- [ ] Implement the docs ;)
