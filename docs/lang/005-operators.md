# Operators

## Binary operations

### Addition
You can perform addition with the plus character : `+`. e.g.: `a + b`
```
$primary_expr + $primary_expr
```

### Soustraction
You can perform soustractions with the minus character : `-`.e.g.: `a - b`
```
$primary_expr - $primary_expr
```

### Multiplication
You can perform multiplication with the times character : `*`. e.g.: `a * b`
```
$primary_expr * $primary_expr
```

### Division
You can perform division with the divide character : `/`. e.g.: `a / b`
```
$primary_expr / $primary_expr
```

### Modulo
You can perform modulo with the percent character : `%`. e.g.: `a % b`
```
$primary_expr % $primary_expr
```

### Power
You can perform power with the circumflex character : `^`. e.g.: `a ^ b`
```
$primary_expr ^ $primary_expr
```
